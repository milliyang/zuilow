# PPT - Paper Trade Platform

A lightweight paper trading platform supporting multi-account management, real-time market data, trade simulation, performance analytics, and webhook signal reception.

> Built from scratch due to lack of clean, decoupled, and well-architected existing solutions.

Sub-project of **ZuiLow** all-in-one AI trading platform; can be deployed standalone.

## OpenTimestamps Integration

The platform includes built-in OpenTimestamps support for creating tamper-proof timestamps of account and trade data:

- **Multiple Timestamps per Day**: Support for different market close times (e.g., US market at 16:00, HK market at 22:00)
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Configurable cron jobs for automatic timestamp creation
- **Labeled Timestamps**: Optional labels to distinguish different markets or strategies
- **File Format**: `record_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json` or `record_YYYY-MM-DD_label.json`

See [OpenTimestamps Documentation](opents/readme.md) for detailed configuration.
