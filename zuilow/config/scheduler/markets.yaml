# Per-market execution: HK/US/BTC each have their own execution jobs; 
# at trigger time they consume that market's pending signals.
#
# market_open_time (e.g. "09:30") + market_timezone (e.g. "America/New_York") together
# give the open time for that market. The runner uses only these two fields from this file; 
# there is no hardcoded market→timezone map in code.
#
# open_bar_minutes: during the session, run the executor every N minutes (e.g. 5 → 09:30, 09:35, 09:40…)
# to consume pending signals for that market. Used by auto-added exec_{market}_bar jobs.
#
# market_close_time: run the executor once at this time (e.g. "16:00") to consume remaining pending signals.
# Used by auto-added exec_{market}_close jobs.
